[General]
# iwd is capable of performing network configuration on its own, including
# DHCPv4 based address configuration.  By default this behavior is
# disabled, and an external service such as NetworkManager, systemd-network
# or dhcpclient is required.  Uncomment the following line if you want iwd
# to manage network interface configuration.
#
EnableNetworkConfiguration=true
#
# iwd can randomize your WiFi card's MAC address for additional privacy.  By
# default, this behavior is disabled and the MAC address assigned by the
# kernel driver is used.  The address will be stable when connecting
# to a saved network profile, so as to not interfere with any MAC filtering
# rules that exist on the network.
# If a randomized MAC address is desired, uncomment the setting line below:
#
AddressRandomization=network
#
# Options below control the roaming thresholds on 2.4 & 5G bands.
# Normally the default values are a good compromise that avoids excessive
# scanning while maintaining good link quality.
#
#RoamThreshold=-70
#RoamThreshold5G=-76
#
[Network]
# If EnableNetworkConfiguration=true is set, iwd forwards DNS information to
# the system resolving service.  The currently supported services are:
# - systemd-resolved ["systemd"]
# - openresolv / resolvconf ["resolvconf"]
# - none
#
# If not set, the value "systemd" is used by default.  Uncomment the value
# below if you are using openresolv:
#
#NameResolvingService=resolvconf
#
# iwd's support for IPv6 should be stable enough and is now enabled by default.
# If you experience any problems and want to force IPv6 to be disabled,
# uncomment the setting below:
#EnableIPv6=false
